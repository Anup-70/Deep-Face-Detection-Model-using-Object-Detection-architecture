# Face Detection Project

This project demonstrates face detection using Python and OpenCV. The Jupyter Notebook provided (`FaceDetection.ipynb`) contains all the necessary code and explanations to perform face detection on images.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to showcase the implementation of a simple face detection model. The project uses the OpenCV library, which is widely used for computer vision tasks. The face detection is performed using a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier.

## Requirements

To run the code in the notebook, you will need the following Python packages:

- `opencv-python`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

These can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
